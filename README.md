# Swipe! - Swipe on People, Pets and Products to Find Your Matches.
Swipe! is a swipe left, swipe right UI based on popular modern dating apps.

This project demonstrates how to produce and manage swipable cards using the MVVM architecture. Each type of card (person, pet, car, house) is represented using a model, which can in turn produce the view model for a card. Each card is popped into the stack and managed using a linked list.

This project is developed programmatically, without the use of storyboards. Demonstrates the use of the MVVM architecture for a more complex UI, and incorporates some keyframed animation for adding more exciting visal elements to the user experience.

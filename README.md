# Swipe! - Swipe on People, Pets and Products to Find Your Matches.
Swipe! is a swipe left, swipe right UI based on popular modern dating apps.

This project demonstrates how to produce and manage swipable cards using a hybryd design pattern (features from MVVM and MVP). Each type of card (person, pet, car, house) is represented using a model, which can in turn produce the view model for a card. The card deck is then managed as a linked list.

This project is developed programmatically, without the use of storyboards. Demonstrates a more complex design pattern for a complex UI, and incorporates some keyframed animation for adding more exciting visal elements to the user experience.
